#### Run Locally

1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. You'll need a Google Maps API key - get one [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and set up your `.env` file, using `.env.example` as a guide.
2. `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Open up `localhost:8080` in your browser and you should see the map!
4. Make some changes - various configuration options can be found in `index.jsx`. Hit save, and the page will reload with your new code.
